# D-DDMTools
A java application that attempts to make DMing a D&amp;D campaign easier. Particularly, I want to focus on a tool that helps generate maps from a preexisting idea. Ex. a city of three concentric circles. As well as doing some of the management to make created fictional worlds more realistic in that things happen outside the campaign.
